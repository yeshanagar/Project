# Adult Income Analysis
The dataset named “Adult Data Set” was referred and downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.  It consists of multi-variate data, with a total of 14 attributes. This data is extracted from a census database. The dataset has categorical and integer attributes with 48842 instances. It comprises of 7% of missing values in whole and they are represented with ‘?’ symbol in the data. <br> <br>
The project leads with a classification-based problem on the attribute ‘income’ which possesses a binary response ‘>50K’ or ‘<=50K’. This also becomes the goal of the project to determine whether a person makes over 50K per year or not. The other attributes are demographics of the population such as age, work class, fnwgt, education, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain, capital loss, hours-per-week, native country.  The complete procedure and analysis are carried over Python Jupyter Notebook launched on Anaconda platform on a mac operating system.
